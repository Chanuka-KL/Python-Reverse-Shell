# Reverse Shell in Python üêç

This project demonstrates a simple reverse shell setup using Python, allowing an attacker to execute shell commands on a remote victim machine.

## Project Structure üìï

- **attacker.py**: The attacker's script to listen for a connection and send commands.
- **victim.py**: The victim's script that connects back to the attacker and executes commands.

## How to Use üßæ

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chanuka-Kl/Python-Reverse-Shell.git
    cd Python-Reverse-Shell
    ```

2. **Configure the Attacker's Script**:
    - Edit `attacker.py` and set the `attacker_ip` to your public IP address.
  
3. **Configure the Victim's Script**:
    - Edit `victim.py` and set the `attacker_ip` to your public IP address.

4. **Run the Attacker's Script**:
    On your machine (attacker):
    ```bash
    python3 attacker.py
    ```

5. **Run the Victim's Script**:
    On the victim's machine:
    ```bash
    python3 victim.py
    ```

6. **Send Commands**:
    Once the victim is connected, you can execute commands from the attacker's machine. To exit, type `exit`.
